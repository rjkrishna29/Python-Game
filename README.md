# Python Cricket Cup

## Description

Welcome to the **Python Cricket Cup**! This is a command-line game that combines elements of cricket with the classic Stone-Paper-Scissors game. Compete against the computer in a simulated cricket match where you can choose to bat or bowl and try to score the most runs or take the most wickets.

## Features

- **Command-line Interface**: Play directly in your terminal.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Choose to bat or bowl, and play multiple overs.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `cricket.py`.

## How to Play

   ```bash

   ```

2. **Register Your Name**: Enter your name to start playing.
3. **Toss**: Choose between "heads" or "tails" to win the toss and decide whether to bat or bowl.
4. **Play**:
   - If you choose to bat, try to score as many runs as possible before losing all your wickets.
   - If you choose to bowl, try to restrict the computerâ€™s runs and take all its wickets.
5. **Match Outcome**: The game will display the result of the match and whether you won or lost.
